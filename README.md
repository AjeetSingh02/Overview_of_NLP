# Overview_of_NLP

A Python notebook having an overview of NLP, NLP libraries and NLP models. I made this notebook while I was studying 
NLP through some courses and some blogs.
So this notebook is a combination of my understanding and the knowledge on those blogs and couses.

In this notebook you will find these topics along with codes(wherever possible):

1. Overview, history, and difficulties of NLP.
2. Major Applications.
3. How it works: Tokenization, Normalization and feature extraction(BOW,TFIDF).
4. How to make a Sentiment Classifier.
5. Overview of NLP libraries including Spacy, NLTK etc.
6. Pros and Cons of these libraries.
7. How to use these libraries.
8. Overview of NLP Pre-trained models.
